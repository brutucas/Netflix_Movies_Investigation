**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex my exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. 

As a fictional backstory, a friend of mine has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. He believes that the average duration of movies has been declining. Is he correct?

I am going to start with the initial research and delve into the Netflix data, in order to see if I can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.

I already have a dataset `netflix_data.csv`, which contains data stored in the following columns. The table below contains column names and descriptions.

## The data
